<body>
    <div class="sticky">
        <p>
            The sticky property is used as a positioning for this box and you can see that this box is sticked on the
            top when you scroll the screen. You can also see the code below
        </p>
        <code>
            position: sticky;
            background-color: rgb(3, 87, 59);<br/>
            top:0px;
        </code>
    </div>

    <div class="static">
        <p>
            This is the default state (i.e static) of css positioning and the box is positioned according to the normal
            flow. The top, right, bottom, left and z-index properties have no effect.
        </p>

        <code>
            position: static;
            background-color: rgb(255, 0, 0);<br/>
            margin-left: 200px;
        </code>
    </div>

    <div class="fixed">
        <p>
            This is fixed state of this box where the box is removed from the normal document flow, and no space is
            created for the box in the page layout. Using this positioning you can fix the position of any element.
        </p>
        <code>
            position: fixed;
            background-color: rgb(98, 98, 3);<br/>
            left: 400px;
        </code>
    </div>



    <div class="relative">
        <p>
            The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document, and then offset relative to itself
            based on the values of top, right, bottom, and left.
        </p>
        <code>
            position: relative;
            background-color: rgb(3, 80, 3);<br/>
            top:200px;<br/>
            left: 600px;
        </code>
    </div>

    <div class="absolute">
        <p>The element is removed from the normal document flow, and no space is created for the element in the page
            layout. It is positioned relative to its closest positioned ancestor, if any; otherwise, it is placed
            relative to the initial containing block. Its final position is determined by the values of top, right,
            bottom, and left.</p>

        <code>
            position: absolute;
            background-color: rgb(165, 42, 42);<br/>
            top: 800px;<br/>
            left: 800px
        </code>
