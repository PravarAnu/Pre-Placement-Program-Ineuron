Q. What’s difference between map & forEach?

Ans-

map()
The map() method returns an entirely new array.
The map() method returns the newly created array according to the provided callback function.
With the map() method, we can chain other methods like, reduce(),sort() etc.
It does not change the original array.


forEach()
The forEach() method does not returns a  new array based on the given array.
The forEach() method returns “undefined“.
The forEach() method doesn’t return anything hence the method chaining technique cannot be applied here. 
It is not executed for empty elements.
