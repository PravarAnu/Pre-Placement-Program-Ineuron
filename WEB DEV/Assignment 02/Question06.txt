Q. What’s z-index and How does it Function? 

Ans-
The z-index property assigns a numerical value to an element, determining its position in the stacking order. Elements with higher z-index values will appear on top of elements with lower values. If two elements have the same z-index, their stacking order will be determined by their position in the HTML structure, with the element that appears later in the code stacking on top.

The z-index property can be applied to positioned elements whose values are "relative", "absolute", and "fixed". By default, positioned elements have a z-index value of auto, which means their stacking order is determined by the parent-child hierarchy.
For Example : 
.my-element-1{
      Position: absolute;
      Z-index: 2;
}
.my-element-2{
      Position: absolute;
      Z-index: 1 
}
