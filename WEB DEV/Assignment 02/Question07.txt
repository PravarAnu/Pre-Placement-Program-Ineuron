Q. What’s Grid & Flex and difference between them?

Ans-
- Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout system designed for laying out elements in a single row or column. It's useful for creating flexible and dynamic layouts, especially for components that need to adjust their size or alignment to accommodate varying content.

Key features of Flexbox:
One-dimensional: Flexbox operates along either the horizontal (row) or vertical (column) axis.
Content order: Flexbox allows you to easily reorder elements visually, regardless of their order in the HTML markup.
Flexible sizing: Flexbox provides flexible options for sizing elements, allowing them to expand, shrink, or distribute space evenly.
Alignment: Flexbox offers powerful alignment capabilities, allowing you to control the positioning of elements within a container.

For example: 
HTML-
<div class="wrapper">
  <div>One</div>
  <div>Two</div>
  <div>Three</div>
  <div>Four</div>
  <div>Five</div>
</div>

CSS-
.wrapper {
  width: 500px;
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
}
.wrapper > div {
  flex: 1 1 150px;
}


- Grid is a two-dimensional layout system that enables you to create complex and grid-like layouts. It provides a more extensive set of features compared to Flexbox and allows you to define rows and columns to position and align elements precisely.

Key features of Grid Layout:
Two-dimensional: Grid operates on both the horizontal and vertical axes, allowing you to define rows and columns to create a grid-like structure.
Grid lines and tracks: Grid lets you define explicit grid lines and tracks, allowing you to control the placement and size of elements precisely.
Grid items: Elements inside a grid container can be placed in any cell, and their size and alignment can be controlled at both the row and column level.
Responsive layouts: Grid makes it easier to create responsive designs by defining different grid structures for different screen sizes.

For example: 
HTML-
<div class="wrapper">
  <div>One</div>
  <div>Two</div>
  <div>Three</div>
  <div>Four</div>
  <div>Five</div>
</div>

CSS-
.wrapper {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
}


- Main differences between Flexbox and Grid:
Dimension: Flexbox is one-dimensional (row or column), while Grid is two-dimensional (rows and columns).

Layout control: Grid provides more precise control over the placement of elements within the grid structure, whereas Flexbox focuses on flexible and dynamic layouts.

Content order: Flexbox allows easy reordering of elements, while Grid follows the order of elements in the HTML markup.

Complexity: Grid has a more extensive feature set and can handle complex layouts, making it suitable for creating large-scale designs. Flexbox is simpler and more suitable for smaller components or single-axis layouts.
