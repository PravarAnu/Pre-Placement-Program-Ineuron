Q. What’s difference between Synchronous and Asynchronous?

Ans -
Synchronous means something is doing sequentially if any process takes time then all other tasks after that wait for that taks to complete.
Synchronous means to be in a sequence, i.e. every statement of the code gets executed one by one. So, basically a statement has to wait for the earlier statement to get executed.



Asynchronous code allows the program to be executed immediately where the synchronous code will block further execution of the remaining code until it finishes the current one. This may not look like a big problem but when you see it in a bigger picture you realize that it may lead to delaying the User Interface.
