Q. Explain SetTimeOut and setInterval ?

Ans-
    JavaScript SetTimeout and SetInterval are the only native function in JavaScript that is used to run code asynchronously, it means allowing the function to be executed immediately, there is no need to wait for the current execution completion, it will be for further execution.

    JavaScript setTimeout() Method: This method executes a function, after waiting a specified number of milliseconds. 

    Syntax:

    Syntax:

    window.setInterval(function, milliseconds);
    Parameter: There are two parameters that accepted by this method
