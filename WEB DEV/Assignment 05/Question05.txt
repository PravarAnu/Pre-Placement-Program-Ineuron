Q. What are Callbacks &  Callback Hell ?

Ans-
Callbacks are nothing but functions that take some time to produce a result.
Usually, these async callbacks (async short for asynchronous) are used for accessing values from databases, downloading images, reading files, etc.
As these take time to finish, we can neither proceed to the next line because it might throw an error saying unavailable nor we can pause our program.
So we need to store the result and call back when it is complete.


This is a big issue caused by coding with complex nested callbacks. Here, each and every callback takes an argument that is a result of the previous callbacks. In this manner, The code structure looks like a pyramid, making it difficult to read and maintain. Also, if there is an error in one function, then all other functions get affected. 


JavaScript provides an easy way of escaping from callback hell. This is done by event queue and promises.
A promise is a returned object from any asynchronous function, to which callback methods can be added based on the previous function’s result.
Promises use .then() method to call async callbacks. We can chain as many callbacks as we want and the order is also strictly maintained.
Promises use .fetch() method to fetch an object from the network. It also uses .catch() method to catch any exception when any block fails.
So these promises are put in the event queue so that they don’t block subsequent JS code. Also once the results are returned, the event queue finishes its operations.
There are also other helpful keywords and methods like async, wait, set timeout() to simplify and make better use of callbacks.
