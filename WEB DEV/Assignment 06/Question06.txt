Q. Whats Polymorphism and Purpose of it?

Ans -
Polymorphism is a key concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows objects of different classes to be treated as instances of a common superclass. It enables you to use a single interface to represent different types of objects, providing flexibility and extensibility to your code.

In JavaScript, polymorphism is achieved through method overriding or method overloading. Here's an explanation of these two types of polymorphism and their purpose:

1. Method Overriding: Method overriding is a form of polymorphism where a subclass provides a different implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. By overriding a method, you can change its behavior in the subclass while maintaining the same method signature (name and parameters).

   The purpose of method overriding in JavaScript is to:

   - Customize behavior: By overriding methods, you can tailor the implementation of a method to suit the specific needs of a subclass. This allows you to modify or extend the behavior of the superclass method while keeping the same method name and interface.

   - Follow the "open-closed" principle: Method overriding supports the principle of being "open for extension but closed for modification." You can add new functionality to a class by creating a subclass and overriding specific methods without modifying the original class. This promotes code reusability and maintainability.

2. Method Overloading: Method overloading is a form of polymorphism where multiple methods with the same name but different parameters are defined within a class. The appropriate method to execute is determined by the number or types of arguments passed during the method invocation.

   Note: JavaScript does not support method overloading natively. However, you can simulate method overloading by using conditional statements within a single method.

   The purpose of method overloading (or simulating it) in JavaScript is to:

   - Provide flexibility: By allowing a method to accept different combinations of arguments, you provide flexibility to the users of your code. They can choose the appropriate version of the method based on their needs.

   - Enhance code readability: Method overloading, even if simulated, can improve code readability by providing descriptive method names that indicate the intended behavior based on the arguments used. This makes the code more self-explanatory and easier to understand.

Here's an example that demonstrates both method overriding and simulated method overloading in JavaScript:


class Shape {
  calculateArea() {
    return 0;
  }
}

class Circle extends Shape {
  constructor(radius) {
    super();
    this.radius = radius;
  }

  calculateArea() {
    return Math.PI * this.radius ** 2;
  }
}

class Rectangle extends Shape {
  constructor(width, height) {
    super();
    this.width = width;
    this.height = height;
  }

  calculateArea() {
    return this.width * this.height;
  }
}

const shapes = [new Circle(5), new Rectangle(4, 6)];

shapes.forEach((shape) => {
  console.log(shape.calculateArea());
});


In the example above, the `Shape` class has a `calculateArea()` method, which is overridden in the `Circle` and `Rectangle` subclasses. Each subclass provides its own implementation of the method, allowing for polymorphic behavior.

By creating instances of `Circle` and `Rectangle` and calling the `calculateArea()` method, we can see that the appropriate implementation is automatically invoked based on the actual type of the object. This demonstrates polymorphism in action, where different objects are treated uniformly through a common superclass interface.
