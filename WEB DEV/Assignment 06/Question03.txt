Q. What’s call, apply, bind Method & Difference Between them

Ans-

“.call()”, “.apply()”, and ".bind()" methods are used to manipulate the execution context and the value of "this" within a function. They allow you to explicitly set the context in which a function is called.

The key differences between these methods lie in how they accept arguments and their immediate or deferred execution.

".call()": This method invokes a function immediately, passing arguments individually.

For example:

const obj = { name: "Pravar" };

function greet(message) {
  console.log("${message}, ${this.name}!");
}

greet.call(obj, "Hello");

Output:
Hello, Pravar!

In the above example, the "greet" function is called with the "obj" as the execution context using ".call()". The arguments are passed individually after the execution context.

 ".apply()": This method invokes a function immediately, passing arguments as an array.

For example:
const obj = { name: "Anu" };

function greet(message) {
  console.log("${message}, ${this.name}!");
}

greet.apply(obj, ["Hi"]);

Output:
Hi, Anu!

In this example, the "greet" function is called with the "obj" as the execution context using ".apply()". The arguments are passed as an array.

".bind()": This method returns a new function with a bound execution context and optional preset arguments. The original function is not immediately invoked.

For example:

const obj = { name: "Uljulul" };

function greet(message) {
  console.log("${message}, ${this.name}!");
}

const boundGreet = greet.bind(obj);
boundGreet("Hey");

Output:
Hey, Uljulul!

In this example, ".bind()" returns a new function "boundGreet" that is permanently bound to the "obj" execution context. The original "greet" function is not executed until "boundGreet" is called.
