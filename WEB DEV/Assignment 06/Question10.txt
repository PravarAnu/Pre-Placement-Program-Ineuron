Q. What’s Super Keyword & What it does?

Ans - 
In JavaScript, the `super` keyword is used to call functions or access properties on an object's parent or superclass. It is often used within a subclass to invoke the constructor or methods of the superclass, providing a way to extend or override their functionality.

The `super` keyword can be used in two main contexts:

1. Accessing the Parent Constructor: When creating a subclass, the `super` keyword is used in the subclass's constructor to call the constructor of its superclass. This ensures that the initialization code in the superclass constructor is executed before the subclass-specific code.

2. Calling Parent Class Methods: The `super` keyword is also used within methods of a subclass to invoke the corresponding method in the superclass. This allows the subclass to override and extend the behavior of the superclass method while still utilizing the original implementation.

Here's an example to demonstrate the usage of the `super` keyword in JavaScript:


class Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  speak() {
    console.log(`${this.name} makes a sound.`);
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  constructor(name, breed) {
    super(name); // Calling the parent constructor
    this.breed = breed;
  }

  speak() {
    super.speak(); // Calling the parent class method
    console.log(`${this.name} barks.`);
  }
}

const dog = new Dog('Buddy', 'Labrador');
dog.speak();


In the example above, the `Animal` class represents a superclass with a constructor and a `speak()` method. The `Dog` class extends the `Animal` class using the `extends` keyword.

Within the `Dog` class, the `super(name)` statement is used in the `Dog` constructor to call the `Animal` constructor with the `name` parameter. This ensures that the `name` property is properly initialized in the `Dog` object, utilizing the functionality of the superclass.

The `speak()` method in the `Dog` class overrides the `speak()` method of the `Animal` class. Within the overridden method, `super.speak()` is used to invoke the `speak()` method of the superclass, which displays the default animal sound. The `speak()` method in the `Dog` class then adds additional behavior specific to dogs by logging a bark sound.

When the `speak()` method is called on the `dog` object, it first invokes the `speak()` method of the `Animal` class through `super.speak()`, displaying the default animal sound, and then adds the bark sound specific to dogs.

In summary, the `super` keyword allows you to call the constructor or methods of the superclass within a subclass. It enables you to extend and override the behavior of the superclass while maintaining access to its functionality.
